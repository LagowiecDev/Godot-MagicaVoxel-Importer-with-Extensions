A fork of CloneDeath's Godot plugin [MagicaVoxel importer with extensions](https://github.com/CloneDeath/MagicaVoxel-Importer-with-Extensions).

This fork adds a number of features that are waiting to be pulled into CloneDeath's plugin.  If you wish to use these features _now_ then use _this_ plugin instead.
- __Hiding layers in MagicaVoxel removes their voxels in Godot.__ - This allows for toggling optional objects in MagicaVoxel, such as clothing and weapons.
- __MagicaVoxel voxels are rendered in Godot in layer order.__ - MagicaVoxel VOX files are now shown with the latest layers "on top" of earlier layers.  This is useful for control when adding tight features where an extra voxel would be inappropriate, such as for facial expressions, or tight clothing.
- __An option to only render the first MagicaVoxel keyframe in Godot.__ - MagicaVoxel now allows for creating multiple keyframes of voxels.  If each keyframe represents a separate pose then it can look strange when they are all rendered together in Godot.  This option fixes that.  It is on by default.
- __Can now access multiple MagicaVoxel keyframes.__ - MagicaVoxel allows for the creation of keyframes for animations.  A new importer has been added for MagicaVoxel VOX files (selectable in the "Import" tab).  The new importer is called "MagicaVoxel MeshLibrary" and represents a MagicaVoxel VOX file as a MeshLibrary which stores each keyframe as a separate mesh.  The original importer is still there.  It is called "MagicaVoxel Mesh" and loads a MagicaVoxel VOX file as a single, static Mesh.
- __A new node-type to easily animate keyframed MagicaVoxel VOX files__ - Once all keyframes are in a MeshLibrary, this node-type, "FramedMeshInstance", lets you easily animate them.  It takes the MeshLibrary and an an integer "Current Frame".  "Current Frame" lets you select which keyframe is display.  You can set "Current Frame" through an AnimationPlayer to animate the VOX sprite.
